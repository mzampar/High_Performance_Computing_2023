slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 376544 ON thin001 CANCELLED AT 2024-02-28T23:47:51 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[41543,0],0] on node thin001
  Remote daemon: [[41543,0],1] on node thin002

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
