# Analysis of the performance of different MPI Collective Operations algorithms

This project consists of the analysis of the performance of different algorithms for two collective operations, Broadcast and Barrier, on the ORFEO architecture.

The measurements were taken leveraging the OSU Benchmark, available at https://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/benchmarks/. To compile it, just sbatch the `comile_benchmark.sh`.
